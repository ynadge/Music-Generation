# Music-Generation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a music generation model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The model is trained on a dataset of MIDI files to learn patterns in musical sequences and generate new, original music.

## Motivation and Problem Significance

The ability to generate novel and meaningful musical compositions has long been a goal of both artists and technologists. With the advent of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning techniques, we have the opportunity to explore new frontiers in music generation. By training a model on a vast dataset of music, we can unlock the potential to create original compositions that capture the essence of human creativity.

## Key Technologies

* TensorFlow/Keras: A powerful deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.   
* PrettyMIDI: A Python library for working with MIDI files, enabling the loading, processing, and generation of musical sequences.   
* NumPy: A fundamental library for numerical operations and array manipulation.   
* Pandas: A data analysis and manipulation library for handling and cleaning the MIDI data.   
* Matplotlib: A plotting library for visualizing data and results.   
* FluidSynth: A software synthesizer for playing MIDI files and generating audio output.

## Future Work

* Conditional Generation: Generate music conditioned on specific styles, genres, or moods.
* Multi-Track Generation: Generate music with multiple instruments.
* Evaluation Metrics: Develop metrics to evaluate the quality of generated music.
